# Welcome to My Research Project: Exploring Differential Robotic Platform

Welcome everyone to this repository, where I´ll to showcase my projects from GIDRA, ( in spanish: "Grupo de Investigación y Desarrollo en Robótica Aplicada") is a research group of applied robotics using PIC, microcontrollers, 3D and PCBs design. Also I want to show my progress of my main project which is a differential robotic platform.
